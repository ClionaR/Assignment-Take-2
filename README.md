# Assignment-Take-2
I had to make a whole new repository because the files for the last one completely disappeared from my files on my laptop, so I have been forced to create a new repository as well as a whole new program and assignment. My new assignment is on dogs and information regarding them.

Second Deliverable: For the end product of my project I created a bar chart and a pie chart. The bar chart displays the dog's breed and age on the x and y axis respectfully. I had to change the whole basis of the assignment two weeks ago as the files disappeared off my laptop and I was unable to find them. I also attempted to implement a 3d visualisation but was unable to implement it the way implement I wanted to so I couldn't use it. I have done the best I can with this project but I found it extremely challenging.
